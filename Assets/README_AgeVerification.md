# Age Verification System - Quick Setup Guide

## What This System Does
✅ Collects user age at app startup  
✅ Ensures COPPA compliance for children under 13  
✅ Automatically configures SDKs with age-appropriate settings  
✅ Integrates with AdMob, AppLovin, Firebase, and GDPR systems  
✅ Provides age-based feature management  

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Basic Integration
Add this to your first scene:
```csharp
// Add AgeVerificationSetup.cs to any GameObject in your startup scene
// Set "Next Scene Name" to your main menu scene
// Done! The system will handle everything automatically
```

### 2. Files Added
- `UserAgeService.cs` - Main age verification system
- `AgeVerificationSetup.cs` - Easy setup helper
- `AgeBasedFeatureManager.cs` - Feature management example
- Updated `AdMobAdsManager.cs` - COPPA-compliant ads
- Updated `GDPRManager.cs` - Age-aware GDPR consent
- Updated `ArcadiaSdkManager.cs` - Integrated initialization

### 3. How It Works
1. **App starts** → Shows age verification screen
2. **User enters age** → System validates and saves age
3. **SDKs initialize** → With appropriate COPPA/GDPR settings
4. **Game continues** → With age-appropriate features enabled

## Age Categories & Compliance

| Age Range | Category | Features | Compliance |
|-----------|----------|----------|------------|
| Under 13 | Child | Limited data collection, no social features, G-rated ads | COPPA compliant |
| 13-17 | Teen | Moderate features, PG-rated content | GDPR compliant |
| 18+ | Adult | Full features, all content ratings | Standard compliance |

## Testing
```csharp
// Reset age verification for testing
UserAgeService.Instance.ResetAgeVerification();

// Test child mode (under 13)
UserAgeService.Instance.SetAge(10);

// Test adult mode (18+)
UserAgeService.Instance.SetAge(25);
```
